    "Supervised learning in machine learning is the task of learning a funcion that maps some inputs to outputs based on some input-output pair. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning we are given labeled data with which we can compare our model's predictions with. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.\n",

For example assigning an email spam or not spam is an example of classification. or Identifying a patient to have cancer or not is also an example of classification."

    "### Support vector machines\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is considered generally to be a classification technique, it but can be used in both types of classification and regression tasks. SVM creates a hyperplane in multi-dimensional space to separate different classes. The main idea of support vector machines is margin maximization that divides data into two classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Support vectors\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, svm works only for linearly separable classes. To make it work on non-linear data we use something called kernels.\n",
    "A kernel transforms an input data space into the required space in which data can be separated linearly. SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick. The kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. There are different types of kernel like linear kernel, polynomial and rbf kernels."

    "The main objective of SVM is to divide the given data in the best possible way into different classes. The distance between the  nearest data points of each class is known as the margin. The goal of svm is to select a hyperplane with the maximum possible margin between support vectors in the given data. It does it in following ways:\n",

    "  - Now, there ae multiple decision boundaaries but which to select? Intuitively, if we select a hyperplane which is close to the data points of one class, then it might not generalize well. So the goal is to choose the hyperplane which is as far as possible from the data points of each category.\n",

    "  ![title](svm3.jpg)\n",
